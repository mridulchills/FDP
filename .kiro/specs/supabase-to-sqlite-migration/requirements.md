# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the Faculty Development Tracking System (FDTS) from Supabase to SQLite with a robust, structured backend architecture. The migration aims to create a self-contained, production-ready system with improved data sovereignty, reduced external dependencies, and enhanced performance for the institution's specific needs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Migration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate from Supabase to SQLite so that we have full control over our data and reduce external service dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use SQLite as the primary database
2. WHEN data is migrated THEN all existing user accounts, submissions, departments, and related data SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN the new database is initialized THEN it SHALL maintain the same data relationships and constraints as the current Supabase schema
4. WHEN the migration runs THEN it SHALL include proper indexing for optimal query performance
5. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 2: Backend API Development

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust Node.js/Express backend API so that the frontend can interact with the SQLite database through well-defined endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is implemented THEN it SHALL provide RESTful API endpoints for all current functionality
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL include proper authentication and authorization middleware
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN they SHALL use proper transaction management and error handling
4. WHEN the API is deployed THEN it SHALL include comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities
5. WHEN API responses are sent THEN they SHALL follow consistent response formats with proper HTTP status codes

### Requirement 3: Authentication System Replacement

**User Story:** As a user, I want to continue logging in with my existing credentials so that the migration doesn't disrupt my access to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users log in THEN they SHALL use the same employee ID and password as before
2. WHEN authentication occurs THEN it SHALL use JWT tokens for session management
3. WHEN passwords are stored THEN they SHALL be properly hashed using bcrypt or similar
4. WHEN user sessions expire THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh gracefully
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 4: File Storage Migration

**User Story:** As a user, I want my uploaded documents to remain accessible so that my submission history is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN they SHALL be stored in a local file system with proper organization
2. WHEN existing files are migrated THEN they SHALL maintain their original paths and accessibility
3. WHEN file operations occur THEN they SHALL include proper validation and security checks
4. WHEN files are served THEN they SHALL be protected by authentication and authorization
5. WHEN file storage reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate warnings

### Requirement 5: Data Integrity and Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust data validation so that data integrity is maintained throughout the migration and ongoing operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is inserted or updated THEN it SHALL be validated against defined schemas
2. WHEN database operations occur THEN they SHALL maintain referential integrity
3. WHEN validation fails THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided to users
4. WHEN data migration occurs THEN it SHALL include verification of data completeness and accuracy
5. WHEN concurrent operations happen THEN the system SHALL handle them safely without data corruption

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to perform as well or better than the current Supabase implementation so that my workflow is not impacted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL complete within acceptable time limits
2. WHEN the system handles multiple concurrent users THEN performance SHALL remain stable
3. WHEN large datasets are processed THEN the system SHALL use pagination and efficient queries
4. WHEN the database grows THEN performance SHALL be maintained through proper indexing
5. WHEN system resources are monitored THEN they SHALL provide insights for optimization

### Requirement 7: Development and Production Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment configuration so that development, testing, and production deployments are consistent and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environments are set up THEN they SHALL have separate database instances
2. WHEN configuration is managed THEN it SHALL use environment variables for sensitive data
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL include proper backup and recovery procedures
4. WHEN development occurs THEN it SHALL include database seeding and migration scripts
5. WHEN production is deployed THEN it SHALL include monitoring and health check endpoints

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the frontend interface to work exactly as before so that I don't need to learn new processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing frontend functionality SHALL work unchanged
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL return data in the same format as before
3. WHEN user workflows are executed THEN they SHALL follow the same patterns as the current system
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled and displayed consistently with current behavior
5. WHEN the system is accessed THEN the user experience SHALL be identical or improved

### Requirement 9: Security Enhancement

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want enhanced security measures so that the system is more secure than the current Supabase implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL include proper rate limiting
2. WHEN sensitive operations occur THEN they SHALL be logged for audit purposes
3. WHEN user input is processed THEN it SHALL be sanitized to prevent injection attacks
4. WHEN file uploads happen THEN they SHALL be scanned and validated for security
5. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL include security headers and HTTPS enforcement

### Requirement 10: Monitoring and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and maintenance tools so that I can ensure system reliability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL provide health check endpoints for monitoring
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail for debugging
3. WHEN database maintenance is needed THEN it SHALL include automated backup procedures
4. WHEN system metrics are collected THEN they SHALL provide insights into usage patterns
5. WHEN maintenance tasks run THEN they SHALL not disrupt normal system operations
