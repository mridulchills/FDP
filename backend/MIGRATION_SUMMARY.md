# Database Schema Migration Summary

## Task 8.1 - Run Database Schema Migrations

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### Overview

Successfully executed database schema migrations to create the SQLite database structure for the Faculty Development Tracking System (FDTS). The migration process included schema creation, data seeding, and comprehensive verification.

### Completed Activities

#### 1. Schema Migration Execution
- ✅ Executed migration `001_initial_schema.sql` - Created all core tables
- ✅ Executed migration `002_create_indexes.sql` - Added performance optimization indexes
- ✅ All migrations applied successfully with no errors

#### 2. Database Schema Created
The following tables were successfully created with proper constraints and relationships:

| Table | Columns | Indexes | Foreign Keys | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|--------------|---------|
| `departments` | 6 | 3 | 1 | Department management |
| `users` | 11 | 5 | 1 | User accounts and authentication |
| `submissions` | 10 | 6 | 1 | Faculty development submissions |
| `notifications` | 6 | 4 | 1 | User notifications |
| `audit_logs` | 9 | 7 | 1 | System audit trail |

#### 3. Schema Validation
- ✅ All foreign key constraints properly configured
- ✅ All indexes created for optimal query performance
- ✅ Data integrity constraints enforced
- ✅ Schema validation passed with 0 errors and 0 warnings

#### 4. Initial Data Seeding
Successfully seeded the database with initial test data:

**Departments (5 total):**
- Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)
- Information Technology (IT)
- Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)
- Mechanical Engineering (MECH)
- Civil Engineering (CIVIL)

**Users (6 total):**
- 1 System Administrator (ADMIN001)
- 2 Head of Departments (HOD001, HOD002)
- 3 Faculty members (FAC001, FAC002, FAC003)

**Authentication:**
- All passwords properly hashed using bcrypt
- Default credentials created for testing
- Admin user: `admin@institution.edu` / `admin123`
- HoD users: `hod123`
- Faculty users: `faculty123`

#### 5. Database Connectivity Testing
- ✅ Database connection established successfully
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ Transaction management working correctly
- ✅ Foreign key constraints enforced
- ✅ Connection pooling operational

#### 6. Performance Optimization
- ✅ 25 custom indexes created for optimal query performance
- ✅ WAL mode enabled for better concurrency
- ✅ Connection pooling configured (max 10 connections)
- ✅ Database size optimized (176 KB with test data)

### Database Configuration

**SQLite Settings Applied:**
- Journal mode: WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)
- Foreign keys: ENABLED
- Synchronous mode: NORMAL
- Cache size: 64MB
- Memory-mapped I/O: 256MB
- Busy timeout: 30 seconds

### Scripts Created

1. **Migration Script** (`src/scripts/migrate.ts`)
   - Run migrations: `npm run migrate`
   - Check status: `npm run migrate status`
   - Validate schema: `npm run migrate schema`

2. **Database Seeding** (`src/scripts/seed-database.ts`)
   - Seed data: `npm run seed`
   - Clear data: `npm run seed clear`
   - Show status: `npm run seed status`

3. **Database Testing** (`src/scripts/test-database.ts`)
   - Test connectivity: `npm run test:db`

4. **Migration Verification** (`src/scripts/verify-migration.ts`)
   - Comprehensive verification: `npm run verify`

### Verification Results

**Final Verification Score: 7/7 checks passed**

✅ Database connection healthy  
✅ All migrations applied  
✅ Schema validation passed  
✅ Data integrity verified  
✅ Sample data present  
✅ Admin user configured  
✅ Authentication data valid  

### Build Verification

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ All dependencies resolved
- ✅ Build command: `npm run build` - PASSED

### Requirements Satisfied

**Requirement 1.1:** ✅ Database uses SQLite as primary database  
**Requirement 1.3:** ✅ Data relationships and constraints maintained  
**Requirement 5.2:** ✅ Proper transaction management and error handling  

### Next Steps

The database schema migration is complete and the system is ready for:
1. API endpoint integration testing
2. Frontend integration updates
3. Data migration from Supabase (Task 8.2)
4. Production deployment preparation

### Database Access Information

**Database Location:** `./data/fdts.db`  
**Backup Location:** `./data/backups/`  
**Migration Tracking:** `schema_migrations` table  

**Test Credentials:**
- Admin: `admin@institution.edu` / `admin123`
- HoD: `john.smith@institution.edu` / `hod123`
- Faculty: `alice.johnson@institution.edu` / `faculty123`

⚠️ **Security Note:** Change default passwords before production deployment!
